Welcome to the Caravela
====================

In the 15th century the Portuguese built ships that could take her crews further a 
way from land than any previous vesel, empowering a generation of bold explorers and traders.

In that spirit we've created Caravela to gain deeper insights about the web and how it's built. 
Think of us as a search engine that gives you answers to questions such as:

* What's the average size of a web page?
* Which javascript plugins are tho most popular?
* What font is trendy right now?
* How many pages contain invalid content?

We don't intend to answer just those questions. Our goal is to empower you to ask ones we have
not thought of and share your discoveries with the world. This guide will help you do just that. 
Using the code and instructions you find here, you can help us extract new insights  out of our 
web crawl data and visualize the results for others.
